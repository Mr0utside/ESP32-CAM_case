# ESP32-CAM_case
This is a remix of [glytchtech's](https://github.com/glytchtech/ESPCam) ESP32-Cam case. The changes include padding so the ESP32 board is snug inside the case, a cavity for a INMP441 microphone, and a hole for the flash LED included on the board. The two parts are held together by M3x12 screws.
