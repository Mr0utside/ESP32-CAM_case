# ESP32-CAM case

## Intro

This is the design of a case to house an ESP32-CAM board along with a INMP441 microphone, a charge controller, and a 18650 cell. The case is held together by two M3x12 screws. This is a remix of [glytchtech's](https://github.com/glytchtech/ESPCam) case. The idea is to have a portable camera that is easy to program and deploy. 

# Changes over the original
- Padding for the ESP32-CAM board.
- Cavity for a INMP441 microphone
- Hole to make the flash LED on the ESP board usable
- Smaller slide switch
- Slide in cavity for the charge controller
